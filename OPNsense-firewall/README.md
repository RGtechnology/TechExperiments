# OPNsense Firewall on Proxmox

In this TechExperiment, we will create an OPNsense firewall as a virtual machine (VM) on Proxmox, using a modem/router from your internet provider configured with DHCP.

![TechExperiment | OPNsense environment overview](images/OPNsense-environment-overview.png)


## Prerequisites
- A [Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)](https://proxmox.com/en/downloads) server
- A modem/router from your internet provider with DHCP enabled
- An [OPNsense ISO image](https://opnsense.org/download/)

## Create a New VM for OPNsense
| Step                 | Description |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **General** | Provide a unique ID and a descriptive name for your VM.|
| **OS** | Choose the OPNsense ISO image you uploaded to Proxmox.|
| **System** | Check the box to enable the Qemu Agent for better VM management.|
| **Disks** | Specify the size and storage location for the virtual disk.|
| **CPU** | Allocate CPU resources: 1 socket, 2 cores, and set the type to "host".|
| **Memory** | Allocate 8 GB of RAM for the VM.|
| **Network** | Configure the LAN interface: use vmbr1, set VLAN to 30, and disable the firewall.|
| **Confirm** | Review your settings and create the VM without starting it.|
| **Add: Network Device** | Add an additional network device for the WAN interface: use vmbr1, set VLAN to 999, and disable the firewall.|

## Install OPNsense

| Step                 | Description |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Boot from Installation Media** | Insert the ISO image into the virtual CD/DVD drive of the previously created virtual machine, then power it on. Use the Proxmox console to do the installation. |
| **Start Installation** | Log in as the user `installer` with the password `OPNsense` to proceed the installation. |
| **Select Keyboard Layout** | Choose your preferred keyboard layout from the list. |
| **Configure Disk** | Select the disk where you want to install OPNsense. Choose the appropriate disk formatting option. |
| **Installation Progress** | The installation process will begin. This may take a few minutes. |
| **Change Root Password** | Once the installation is complete, choose the option to change the root password. |
| **Reboot System** | Reboot the system to complete the installation. |
| **Initial Login** | After rebooting, log in as the user `root` and the password you set earlier. |
| **Assign Interfaces** | Assign the network interfaces (e.g., WAN, LAN) as per your network setup. |
| **Initial Configuration** | Your OPNsense firewall is now ready to use! From this point, [continue with the initial configuration](docs/3-initial-opnsense-configuration/README.md) in a browser window. |
